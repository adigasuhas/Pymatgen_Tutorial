## Note:
I will be creating and updating notebooks for each topic weekly, documenting everything I learnt as a beginner. This process will take time as I have to start making notebooks from scratch. I aim to complete all topics within 10 weeks.

Feel free to explore the repository and use the provided tutorials as a guide to enhance your knowledge in computational materials science!
